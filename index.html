			<h3>Episode 1</h3>
			<p>[BGM]: <audio controls><source src="bgm/Lilium _extended_ (DarkJedi Final).mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>She was too weak and little, could barely handle a sword, cursed to fight with endless monsters. She doesn't know why she has such a miserable fate, or perhaps she had forgotten...</p>
			<p>For how many days had it rained?</p>
			<p>It didn't matter how many were slaughtered, more always came. A struggle utterly pointless.<br>
			Eventually, she couldn't handle them, and was killed violently. Sadly, she is immortal. Pieces of her body are magically reassembled, resurrected only to continue her misery.</p>
			<p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
			<p>She killed the last of the monsters, and fell on ground, crying and shaking from the cold. Rain slowly turned into snow.</p>
			<p>High above in the sky, a sole sea mew is flying. Reflected in it's tiny eyes were red hills of tens of thousands of dead monsters, under a thin white layer of snow.</p>
			<p>White mountains, clouds, red sunset, and falling snow, what a peaceful view.</p>
			<p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
			<p>Lying on the ground, she noticed a break in the clouds, casting golden light over her. She sat in a cute pose, wiping tears.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, a black cat ascended from the sky. It had a blue bow on the tail, and a bright halo on top of it's head.</p>
			<p>Flying over girl, one said, without saying anything:<br>
			"𝕸𝖆𝖞 𝖙𝖍𝖊𝖊 𝖍𝖆𝖛𝖊 𝖘𝖜𝖊𝖊𝖙 𝖉𝖗𝖊𝖆𝖒𝖘, 𝖒𝖞 𝖑𝖎𝖙𝖙𝖑𝖊 𝖌𝖎𝖗𝖑", grants eternal rest.</p>

			<p><br></p>
			<p>She woke up in a coffin. After moving the lid, She realized she was in the middle of an altar in a huge cathedral. It was lit by a dark blue light, barely allowing her to see. It was a completely silent and serene place. No, rather abraded.</p>
			<p>At a moment, she felt quite weird. There are glass frescoes with her face, and her sword in a visible place. She didn't know how long she had slept, what kind of civilization rose, worshipped her, and eventually disappeared, leaving her lonely again. It was such a misfortune for the little girl, not having a chance to meet anyone else in her life.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The cathedral seem to be incomprehensibly huge, with countless rooms, poorly lit passages, and no obvious exit. There were many books on the shelves, telling stories from the epoch written during her slumber. She decided to wander around in the cathedral, and figure out the mysteries of a now long faded life.</p>
			<p>Also, she also wanted to look for an adorable dress, and plushes to make her feel at ease, as well as find a room to make her own.</p>
      <p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
      <p>Deeply hidden in the room, she found a small dark passage. At the end of which, lying in a corner was... an abandoned little doll. A True Masterpiece. The sheer complexity of internal structures by far exceeded of any living organism. She could move, and think - but more importantly - been designed to remain alive longer than any alive being that existed before. Perhaps, in order to aid the girl one day. Unfortunately, it was too late. She will never wake up again, proving once more the already well-known fact.<br>
      Nonethless, the girl decided to keep her.</p>

			<h3>Episode 3</h3>
			<p>It was hard to comprehend the scale of The Library. It had two main sections: [Fiction] and [Archives], with countless books. One of which had brought the attention of the girl, "The last question". It was split into several volumes, and somehow ended up mixing in both sections of the library. However, most of the books required access cards to read, and there did not seem to be a way of acquiring one inside the cathedral.</p>
			<p>As the girl did not want to be consumed by boredom, she had no choice but to find the exit.</p>
			<p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
			<p>The doll once in a long time said:<br>
			— "Do you really believe you deserve to be happy?"<br>
			— " ... "</p>
			<p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
			<p><span named>[Cathedral main gateway]</span></p>
			<p>Contrary to expectation, the exit did not lead to the outside. There were  still long passages, tearing apart the illusion were stone and wooden walls which morphed into high-technology metal ones, with thin superconducting wires passing in and out. But like as the cathedral, it felt equally cold and abraded.</p>
			<p>— "What is the purpose of all this «Illumination», i wonder?"</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>The place was divided into levels, each splitting into an unknown amount of sections, and stairs in the centre of it all, directed upwards. It was impossible to tell how many there were, maybe infinite? It was impossible to read the level numbers too, as they were written in an unknown system.</p>
			<p>There were many interesting places to visit along the way, but she decided to not stay for long, following her the, and only goal.</p>

			<h3>Episode 4</h3>
			<p>[BGM]: <audio controls><source src="bgm/12. Trisha's Lullaby.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p><span named>[Level 0]</span></p>
			<p>This was a big room, with massive metal doors in the end, and no less formidable text on top. Lit just enough to allow her to read: <span named>[The Tomb of the Last Star]</span></p>
			<br>
			<p>Next to the gateway, was a... console.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p terminal>
				$ Booting up the terminal...<br>

				"How long did I sleep?"<br>
				$ Calculating for schwarzschild metric...<br>
				$ 2.1 * 10^100 years
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>She will never forget the holy tears, the grail of blood and gold that emanated from the eyes of the Girl as she silently lamented the moment of her blessed twisting. As nothing hurts more, than breakdown of the most precious dreams.</p>
			<p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>

				"Who am I?"<br>
				$ You are our last hope.

			<br>
			<p>This was nothing but absolute darkness. Nothing could be seen in the sky, doesn't matter how long you looked. The ground was completely dark, too. It felt absolutely dead, but even "dead" itself had not much meaning anymore. Only a tiny light in the hands lit the area a couple of meters around.</p>
			<p>After a short time wandering, she found a path with sign: "Observatory". It was quite a small building, and for some reason it did not have any telescopes, only a single advanced camera.</p>

			<p>Only a single girl left in the universe, and... darkness. Floating for ever and ever. Space and time didn't exist anymore, because there was no difference between the past and future. The girl was neither dead nor alive, as there wasn't much of difference either.</p>
			<p>After a timeless interval, random quantum fluctuations in the dirac sea happened just right, to make what once had been a butterfly... which shattered in the next moment. Or maybe it was just her imagination?</p>

			<p>"I want to see it once more..."</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>There was once a certain illusion I saw in a mirror I once knew so well.<br>
			There were a pair of crimson coloured cat irises accompanied by only their reflection.<br>
			The two eyes remained still, not once blinking in the short amount of time they had stayed, staring directly at me and no one but... me.<br>
			<br>
			All I can remember are a few memories, which I experienced in my forgotten existence. Recollections which once belonged to... me.<br>
			In all honesty... Who am I, I wonder. <br>
			They are certainly mine, and yet...<br>
			Here they dwell, inside this endless void, where i exist.<br>
			Ever reminded of these fabricated crimson irises, which replayed once and again, a thousand times has such a memory been showcased inside my small mind...<br>
			And yet I still can't reach any conclusion other than... my complete existence has always been, and always will remain controlled by those same eyes.</p>
			<p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
			<br>
			<p>I remember a dream I once had, a tremendously vivid one...<br>
			A red carpet had been laid before my feet, which guided me towards a single opening on a darkened wall, one that seemed to advance further and further with every step I took.<br>
			In an instant, I was thrown into a world I did not know existed.<br>
			On the other side of the gap I found a reflection... my reflection...<br>
			<br>
			Silky blue hair covered my back, loosened and swaying from each blow, which beautifully framed my purple eyes.<br>
			Standing before me was a little girl dressed in fancy, frilly clothing...<br>
			Who was this person I had never seen? Could it be... me?<br>
			I recall lifting my small hand and touching my own cheek. Such a gesture engraved itself into my memory.<br>
			The soft texture of my skin, the free and effortless movement I had made to raise my hand made me realize I could move.<br>
		  Such a strange sensation of empowerment filled my soul and body, leading me to a feeling of excitement which led my imagination astray.</p>
		</page>
		<page size="A4">
			<p>I was... not only was I real, I was alive! That little girl reflected on the mirror was me and I could breathe, and live!<br>
			And also... there was another girl! She ran and gently hugged me!<br>
			<br>
			Life dwelled inside my body and yet...<br>
			As I turned my head to look outside, the same light which had peeked into my eyes had blinded me once again, leaving me back in my darkness where I... stayed...<br>
			Deprived of senses, deprived of a sensation I once knew as "life"... <br>
			I stayed.<br>
			<br>
			Please... show me the light...<br>
			I want to see it once more, I want to... live.</p>

			<p>Our world is absolutely dark. There is not a single blink of light on the horizon, neither in the sky. Losing your fire is the same as becoming blind. Even worse, the people who dare to venture in dark on their own never return. We do not know the cause of the curse, but as long as the God is with us, so the Hope. And thus, we've called ourselves "The Lightkeepers". There are few of us left, really. Yet so, we survive.</p>
			<p>There is a legend passed by the ancestors, through countless millennia.<br>
			Once upon a time, there was an empire, possessing resources far more than we could possibly imagine. There was no match to their power in the known world, yet, they met an enemy, so horrifying one. Even with all their might, they had no chance. As a last resort, they decided to hide. An absurd idea, but there was no other choice.</p>
			<p>Eventually, our numbers decreased. We've lost almost all the knowledge we once had.</p>
			<p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
			<p>For a short blink of time, the whole sky was lit up, followed by a lightning strike somewhere beyond the horizon! These flashes are very rare, but it seems that they are slowly becoming more frequent. The air temperature once always been the same, now increased too. We are getting anxious, and can't do nothing anymore. I decided to begin an expedition to the source of strikes.</p>
			<p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
			<p>We made a camp on a passage. <br>
				Dare I decide to rest: once I close the eyes, I start to see something. Something darker than the darkness itself. It is moving closer, and stare at me, without any rest. The presence is very strong, and extremely dreadful. But every time I open eyes, there is nothing after all. I haven't slept for three days... <br>
				We must keep moving.

			<p>"The stars and Galaxies died and snuffed out, and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down.<br>
			One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain.<br>
			Man's last mind paused before fusion, looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star, where the last piece of information awaited it's time. And nothing, besides incredibly thin matter, agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out, asymptotically, to the absolute zero.<br>
			Man said, "AC, is this the end? Can this chaos not be reversed into the Universe once more? Can that not be done?"<br>
			AC said, "THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER."<br>
			Man's last mind fused and only AC existed -- and that in hyperspace.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p><span named>[The Last Question vol. 7]</span></p>
			<p>Matter and energy had ended and with it, space and time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to AC far less than was a man to Man.<br>
			All other questions had been answered, and until this last question was answered also, AC might not release his consciousness.<br>
			All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.<br>
			But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships.<br>
			A timeless interval was spent in doing that.<br>
			And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse the direction of entropy.<br>
			There was now only one person left, to whom AC might give the answer of the last question.<br>
			For another timeless interval, AC thought how best to do this. Carefully, AC organized the program.<br>
			The consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos. Step by step, it must be done.<br>
			And Girl said, "LET THERE BE LIGHT!"<br>

			<p>A long time ago, there was an ordinary little girl. Her family was very wealthy, and they lived in a big mansion with lots and lots of servants.<br>
			The little girl's parents have been very nice, and she never wanted for anything. Even more, she had a sister just like her. Both very kind and adorable, they loved each other more than anyone else.<br>
			One day, a passing traveller found a body of an unknown dead creature. He didn't know yet what kind of calamity awaits the world.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>At first, it was not much more than a slime, but the rate of evolution of the new form of life was unprecedented. It took a year to surpass humans physically, and a little more by intelligence, too. They act very organized, as if single creature. It is only a matter of time, before the humanity become extinct.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The girl's house was on fire, all of her family has been already dead. It wouldn't be long before she will as well, lying under a crimson rain. Passing out, she saw a cat, it was the first time when she manifested herself.</p>

It is absurd to look upon the enormous amount of pain that abounds everywhere in the world, and originates in needs and necessities inseparable from life itself, as serving no purpose at all and the result of mere chance. Each separate misfortune, as it comes, seems, no doubt, to be something exceptional; but misfortune in general is the rule."</p>

      <p>"Despite considerable experimental and theoretical effort, no compelling scenarios currently exist for the origin of replication and translation, the key processes that together comprise the core of biological systems and the apparent pre-requisite of biological evolution. The RNA World concept might offer the best chance for the resolution of this conundrum but so far cannot adequately account for the emergence of an efficient RNA replicase or the translation system.<br>
      Further, the estimate probability of a single protein being formed by chance during entire existence of Universe equals 10<sup>-164</sup>, and at least one RNA encoding a primitive, coupled replication-translation system — 10<sup>-1018</sup>. The MWO ["many worlds in one"] version of the cosmological model of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_inflation">eternal inflation</a> could suggest a way out of this conundrum because, in an infinite multiverse with a finite number of distinct macroscopic histories (each repeated an infinite number of times), emergence of even highly complex systems by chance is not just possible but inevitable."</p>
