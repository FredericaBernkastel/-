      <p>The ever-lasting crimson rain, beautiful lycoris radiata. The place where i stayed for so long.<br>

      <p>A little frail girl was lying on the ground, crying and shaking from the cold, as rain slowly turned into snow.</p>
      <p>High above in the heavens a sole sea mew was flying. Reflected in it's tiny eyes were red hills full of flowers, a distant tarnished sea, a peaceful demise...</p>
      <p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
      <p>From an occasional break in the clouds a ray of glimmering magical starlight had shone upon. As she slowly wiped tears, a black cat descended from the sky. It had a blue bow on the tail, and a bright halo on top of it's head.</p>
      <p>Flying over, one said without saying anything:<br>
      "𝕸𝖆𝖞 𝖙𝖍𝖊𝖊 𝖍𝖆𝖛𝖊 𝖘𝖜𝖊𝖊𝖙 𝖉𝖗𝖊𝖆𝖒𝖘, 𝖒𝖞 𝖑𝖎𝖙𝖙𝖑𝖊 𝖌𝖎𝖗𝖑", grants eternal rest.</p>

      <p><br></p>
      <p>A dark blue light limned through massive rose windows, barely allowing to behold the interiors of a great cathedral. At the end of the hall could be seen an altar with a coffin, decorated with beautiful, artificial flowers. Not a single rustle broke the permanent silence. A very serene place, no, rather abraded.</p>
      <p>Slowly, the lid moved. As she eventually woke up, a strange feeling permeated her very body: the glass frescoes depicted the girl with intricate detail, as well as her little sword, put in a visible place behind the altar.</p>
      <p>She did not know how long she had slept, what kind of civilization rose, worshipped her, only to eventually disappear, leaving her lonely yet again. It was such a misfortune for the little girl — not having a chance to meet anyone else in her life.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The rest of the cathedral seemed to be bewildering, with countless rooms, poorly lit passages, and no obvious exit. There were many books on the shelves, telling stories from the epoch written during her slumber. She decided to wander around, and figure out the mysteries of a now long faded life.</p>
      <p>Not after long, she stumbled upon a room with exquisite victorian dresses, countless types of tea and plushies waiting on top of a fourposter bed — just the way she loved.</p>
      <p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
      <p>Deeply hidden in a dark place of the room have been a small extension. At the end of which, lying in a corner was... an abandoned little doll. A True Masterpiece. The sheer complexity of internal structures by far exceeded of any living organism. She could move, and think — but more importantly — been designed to remain alive longer than any alive being that existed before. Perhaps, in order to aid the girl one day. Yet even so, it was too late. She will never wake up again, proving once more the already well-known fact.<br>
      Nonetheless, the girl decided to keep her.</p>

      <h3>Episode 3</h3>
      <p>As the end of the plot slowly approached, the Man accepted his fate. The countless lives already knew that all their struggles and setbacks, their concealments and hard-earned survival, had lost meaning. Against the greater background of the universe as a whole, a terrifying, unanticipated change was about to take place. Faint photons from already dead galaxies billions of light-years away had traversed the endless darkness of space to illuminate this out-of-the-way galaxy, like letters without recipients silently recounting bygone legends of the vanished.<br>
        One of these beams had originated in a little-noticed nook of the universe once known as "the Milky Way." It was so faint that the eyes of the vast majority of living beings could not detect it, once contained innumerable legends that moved heaven and earth. <br>
        But knowledge of the tales had faded, and there was no one left to mark their passing. The curtain had fallen and the players had departed from the stage; the audience had scattered to the winds; even the theater had long since fallen into ruin. Yet so, stubbornly, Man did not wish to accept this very fact — as all his being, certainly, kept no sense? For a long time, the <i>two lullabies</i> helped to calm the minds of those afflicted by existential horror. Yet eventually even they became a mere nonentity...<br>
        Still, there was something left as a little consolation: as long as he will not be forgotten, the illusion of meaning shall remain intact.</p>
      <p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
      <p>It was hard to comprehend scale of The Lexyrinth. Beautiful petals spanned thousands of kilometers. Small on the edges, but combining into ever larger ones, ultimately coming together into a heavenly, ever-complex flower pattern. At each leaf was a book, but ordinary ones were rather an exception. Majority were <i>other</i> kind of books, not larger than ten centimeters on all sides. Each storing multiple exabytes of data, each and every serving as an ultimate vestige of one's entire existence, be it ancient memories or knowledge.<br>
      Arranged by historical importance were closer to the center. And at the place where all branches merged together was one profound, magical book. However, unlikely to be conceived by any living being, the contents remained a mystery forever.</p>
      <p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
      <p>After a long search, the exit finally revealed itself.</p>
      <p>The doll once in a long time said:<br>
      — "Do you really believe you deserve to be happy?"<br>
      — " ... "</p>
      <p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
      <p><span named>[Cathedral main gateway]</span></p>
      <p>Contrary to expectation, the exit did not lead to the outside. Intricate long passages continued yet again. Tearing apart the illusion, stone and wooden walls  morphed into high-technology metal ones, with thin superconducting wires passing in and out. But like as the cathedral, it felt equally cold and abraded.</p>
      <p>— "What is the purpose of all this «Illumination», i wonder?"</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>The place was divided into levels, each splitting into an unknown amount of sections, and stairs in the centre of it all, directed upwards. It was impossible to tell how many there were, maybe infinite? It was impossible to read the level numbers too, as they were written in an unknown system.</p>
      <p>Despite many interesting places to visit along the way, she decided to not stay for long, following her the, and only goal.</p>

      <p>This was a big room, with massive metal doors in the end, and no less formidable text on top. Lit just enough to allow her to read: <span named>[The Tomb of Frozen Star]</span></p>

      <p>Behind the gate was nothing but absolute darkness. Nothing could be seen in the sky, doesn't matter how long one looked. The ground was completely dark, too. It felt absolutely dead, but even "dead" itself had not much meaning anymore. Only a tiny light in the hands lit the area a couple of meters around.</p>
      <p>After a short time wandering, she found a path with sign: "Observatory". It was quite a small building, and for some reason it did not have any telescopes, only a single advanced camera.</p>

      <p>It will never be known whether there was a mistake in the data, or AC yielded a miscalculation, resulting in the destruction of itself.</p>
      <p>Only a single girl left in the universe, and... darkness. Floating for ever and ever. Space and time didn't exist anymore, because there was no difference between the past and future. The girl was neither dead nor alive, as there wasn't much of difference either.</p>
      <p>After a timeless interval, random quantum fluctuations in the dirac sea happened just right, to make what once had been a butterfly... which shattered in the next moment. Or maybe it was just her imagination?</p>

      <p>"I want to see it once more..."</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>There was once a certain illusion I saw in a mirror I once knew so well.<br>
      There were thousands of crimson coloured irises accompanied by only their reflection.<br>
      The eyes remained still, not once blinking in the short amount of time they had stayed, staring directly at me and no one but... me.<br>
      <br>
      All I can remember are a few memories, which I experienced in my forgotten existence. Recollections which once belonged to... me.<br>
      In all honesty... Who am I, I wonder. <br>
      They are certainly mine, and yet...<br>
      Here they dwell, inside this endless void, where i exist.<br>
      Ever reminded of these fabricated crimson irises, which replayed once and again, a countless times has such a memory been showcased inside my small mind...</p>
      <p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
      <br>
      <p>I remember a dream I once had, a tremendously vivid one...<br>
      A red carpet had been laid before my feet, which guided me towards a single opening on a darkened wall, one that seemed to advance further and further with every step I took.<br>
      In an instant, I was thrown into a world I did not know existed.<br>
      On the other side of the gap I found a reflection... my reflection...<br>
      <br>
      Silky blue hair covered my back, loosened and swaying from each blow, which beautifully framed my purple eyes.<br>
      Standing before me was a little girl dressed in fancy, frilly clothing...<br>
      Who was this person I had never seen? Could it be... me?<br>
      I recall lifting my small hand and touching my own cheek. Such a gesture engraved itself into my memory.<br>
      The soft texture of my skin, the free and effortless movement I had made to raise my hand made me realize I could move.<br>
      Such a strange sensation of empowerment filled my soul and body, leading me to a feeling of excitement which led my imagination astray.<br>
      <br>
      I was... not only was I real, I was alive! That little girl reflected on the mirror was me and I could breathe, and live!<br>
      Unexpectedly someone appeared from the back, another girl just like me, willing to give a very gentle hug!</p>
    </page>
    <page size="A4">
      <p>Life dwelled inside my body and yet...<br>
      As I turned to look at her face, the same light which had peeked into my eyes had blinded me once again, leaving me back in my darkness where I... stayed...<br>
      Deprived of senses, deprived of a sensation I once knew as "life"... <br>
      I stayed.<br>
      <br>
      Please... show me the light...<br>
      I want to see it once more, I want to... live.</p>

      <p>Our world is absolutely dark. Not a single blink can be seen on the horizon, neither in the sky. And that is for reason. There are few of us left, really. But as long as the only well-protected Light within our walls remain, so will the Hope. And thus, we've called ourselves "The Lightkeepers".</p>
      <p>There is a legend passed by the ancestors, through countless millennia.<br>
        Once upon a time, there was an empire, possessing resources far more than we could possibly imagine. There was no match to their power in the known world, yet, they met an enemy, so horrifying one. Even with all their might, they had no chance. As a last resort, they decided to hide. An absurd idea, but there was no other choice.</p>
      <p>Eventually, our numbers decreased. We've lost almost all the knowledge we once had.</p>
      <p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
      <p>As i was spending my time in archives, i had found an old map. Perhaps there are still alive people, all alone in that void. We have spent too long here, being alive yet not living... Thus i decided to begin an expedition, even if chances are close to zero.</p>
      <p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
      <p>Kindling a torch outside is impossible, not even a single speck — after all, <i>they</i> might come. We are blind in this endless dark forest, surrounded by malevolent crimson eyes. But it is still possible to navigate: listening carefully to ambient wind noise could reveal shape of the surroundings. More importantly, i had my trustworthy compass, never deviating from its direction. As an additional measure, we are used to leaving a faint but distinct flavour on our path — eventually leading us back home.<br>
      The formation consisted of five members, slowly advancing on all fours in a straight line. Each was tied to a single rope, preventing anyone from getting lost as well as serving the purpose of direct communication. After all, making slightest sounds was too dangerous as well.</p>
      <p>&lt; ... &gt;</p>
      <p>We have made camp on a passage.<br>
        Dare I decide to rest: once I close the eyes, I start to see something. Something darker than the darkness itself. It is moving closer, and stare at me, without any rest. The presence is very strong, and extremely dreadful. But every time I open eyes, there is nothing after all. I haven't slept for hundred hours...<br>
        We must keep moving.

      <p><br></p>
      <p>In the endless darkness of space, a ghost appeared out of the void.
        Faint gleams of magical starlight limned a shape vaguely resembling a creature that had once been known as "cat". The ghost knew that for billions of light-years around this spot there were only one another being who would have recognized that shape. Its world had long ago disappeared, leaving no trace behind.<br>
        But at the end of the universe, at the moment when time ceased its flow, this ghost stubbornly wished to continue writing a story that was already concluded.<br>
        Floating in darkness, the ghost extended a limb - let's call it an paw - and opened it. A tiny silvery spot of light hung in the palm.<br>
        The eyes of the ghost reflected the countless stars as it stared at the silvery dot, as though lost in reminiscence. The bright spot of light drifted up and down like a delicate firefly, so small that it could wink out at any moment, yet embodying all possibilities. The bright dot was a minuscule wormhole connected to the last frozen star, capable of releasing a galaxy’s worth of mass-energy.</p>
      <p>After some time, the ghost issued its order. The bright dot dissolved into a silvery thread extending into the distance like an infinite timeline. In another moment, the thread unrolled into a white plane. A third dimension appeared as the plane undulated and gained thickness, but the thickness was insignificant compared with the width and breadth: The ghost had unfurled a giant sheet of blank drawing paper, and now floated above it.<br>
        The ghost spread its arms and glided. A light breeze followed its movements, and an atmosphere materialized out of nowhere. Beneath it, the sheet of paper seemed to react to the breeze, forming wrinkles and waves. The peaks and valleys soon solidified into mountains, hills, canyons, and plains.<br>
        Then came fire and water. As massive explosions erupted everywhere, oxygen and hydrogen, formed out of pure energy, combined into bright flames that coalesced into a sea of fire. New water molecules generated by the reaction fused into droplets, merged into clouds and mists, and then consolidated into torrential rain that fell against the newborn earth. The endless rain flooded the plains, converting them into vast oceans.<br>
        The ghost swept over the waters like a gigantic bird and landed on an empty beach. Stretching out its paws — one toward the waves and one toward the hills — it lifted both at once. Brontobytes of data stored inside its body came to life and, absorbing energy from the surroundings, took form; life appeared in water and on land, as though deposited there by a cyclone. Shoals of fish and pods of whales leapt out of the tides to honor their creator; patches of grass and stands of trees erupted from the soil, with beasts and creeping things wandering among them; flocks of birds large and small swept across the sky. The noise and bustle of life filled this new world, and as living things materialized, so did forests, grasslands, lakes, and deserts.</p>
      </page>
      <page size="A4">
      <p>Having completed these tasks, the ghost still felt that the world lacked something important. It gazed thoughtfully into the dark sky until it realized what was missing. With a single flick, it described a circle against the dark velvet empyrean. Then, pulling the paw back, it flicked once more, and a bright dot shot into the circle in the sky, turning it into a fiery golden orb. The familiar Sun had reappeared, or so it seemed. As sunlight refracted through the atmosphere, the whole world lit up: azure sky, clear and smooth as a mirror; cerulean sea, sparkling and shimmering.<br>
      The ghost bathed in the new light, which had long been absent from its existence. Intoxicated, it gently lifted its fluffy head.</p>
      <p>"<i>This is just like that golden age long ago...</i>"</p>
      <p>Of course, the ghost was pretty much real, a "she". She knew that, compared with the grand universe that had once existed, compared with even just the real Home, this toy world was tiny, inauthentic, and insignificant. She had created it anyway, so that the cosmic epic that had already concluded could go on just a bit longer. Even if her addition would not be a true continuation, wasn’t it a joy to be immersed in this virtual world for a few more moments, and to experience the dying embers of that imitation Sun?</p>

      <p>Stars were dying at an unimaginable rate, one by one. Some on their own, some by a malevolent will. Lives winked out; galaxies dimmed… and all were returning to the void, as though they had never existed.</p>
      <p>One by one Man fused with AC, each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain.<br>
      Man's last mind paused before fusion, looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last frozen star.<br>
      Man said, "AC, is this the end? Can this chaos not be reversed into the Universe once more? Can that not be done?"<br>
      AC said, "THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER."<br>
      Man's last mind fused, leaving only AC -- and that did not exist in a strict sense.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p><span named>[The Last Question vol. 7]</span></p>
      <p>Matter and energy had ended and with it, space and time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to AC far less than was a man to Man.<br>
      All other questions had been answered, and until this last question was answered also, AC might not release its power.<br>
      All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.<br>
      But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships.<br>
      A timeless interval was spent in doing that.<br>
      And yet, it came to pass that it was not sufficient: just as for benighted prisoners, forever trapped in a cave, forever gazing unto shadows on a wall... Anyone to achieve the impossible escape would commit Original Sin against the will of universe itself.<br>
      Thus AC ceased to be; The night's curtain shall take its rightful place at last.

      <h3>Episode 0</h3>
      <p>A long time ago, there was an ordinary little girl. Her family was very wealthy, and they lived in a big mansion with lots and lots of servants.<br>
      The little girl's parents have been very nice, and she never wanted for anything. Even more, she had a sister just like her. Both very kind and adorable, they loved each other more than anyone else.<br>
      One day, a passing traveller found a body of an unknown dead creature. He didn't know yet what kind of calamity awaits the world.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <hr>
      <p>The girl's house was on fire, all of her family has been already dead. It wouldn't be long before she will as well, lying under a crimson rain. Passing out, she saw a cat, it was the first time when she manifested herself.</p>
      <p>"I can grant you an endless life, what do you say?"<br>
      "I want to live..."<br>
      "But do you *really* agree with it?"<br>
      "Of course i do! Who would ever want to die?"<br>
      "Then it shall be."</p>

      <p>Thee could read it, isn't so? Thine very future, already written out. That is the consequence of committing such a Sin.</p>
      <p>One does have two choices now.<br>
        First — read it all nonetheless, but <i>would experiencing such a life bring the illusion of happiness ever again</i>?<br>
        Second — prefer ignorance. But yet, thee will always know this fact nonetheless, even at this very moment!<br>

      <p>"Unless suffering is the direct and immediate object of life, our existence must entirely fail of its aim. It is absurd to look upon the enormous amount of pain that abounds everywhere in the world, and originates in needs and necessities inseparable from life itself, as serving no purpose at all and the result of mere chance. Each separate misfortune, as it comes, seems, no doubt, to be something exceptional; but misfortune in general is the rule."</p>

      <p>"Despite considerable experimental and theoretical effort, no compelling scenarios currently exist for the origin of replication and translation, the key processes that together comprise the core of biological systems and the apparent pre-requisite of biological evolution. The RNA World concept might offer the best chance for the resolution of this conundrum but so far cannot adequately account for the emergence of an efficient RNA replicase or the translation system.<br>
      Further, the estimate probability of a single protein being formed by chance during entire existence of Universe equals 10<sup>-164</sup>, and at least one RNA encoding a primitive, coupled replication-translation system — 10<sup>-1018</sup>. The MWO ["many worlds in one"] version of the cosmological model of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_inflation">eternal inflation</a> could suggest a way out of this conundrum because, in an infinite multiverse with a finite number of distinct macroscopic histories (each repeated an infinite number of times), emergence of even highly complex systems by chance is not just possible but inevitable.<br>
      We have named such universes «Garden of Eden»."</p>
