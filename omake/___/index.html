        A house was built in an exquisite Victorian style. On one side, the windows faced a dark forest, and on the other — a blooming rosary which reached the horizon. One may find a hidden footpath among the pretty thorns, eventually leading to a secret garden.<br>
        <br>
        Since the world did not exist any more, there was no reason to be concerned of its problems;
        Since the future did not exist any more, there was no reason to worry what happens next — such was a small heaven, devoid of any regrets.<br>
        <br>
        The Sun was no more; a bright Moon's disk now took place in the dark empyrean, illuminating the place with its tranquil, alluring rays. The Lilac bushes opened their flowers, filling the air with a sweet fragrance. The roses, despite appearing pale during the daytime, have been modified to express a new protein in their petals — now all glowed with almost blinding blue light. For such was the stage — fashioned of eternal scourge.<br>
        <br>
        At a table in the secret garden sat a crerub, both beautiful and terrible to behold. She gazed upon own mooncast shadow for a while, then motionlessly flicked one of her wings — as if after a very long sleep.<br>
        Which tea shall it be today? After a short consideration, she settled on simple Earl Grey with milk, softening its bitterness. Then, she decided to bake some sweets and delicate desserts which she loved the most, suiting the tea.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Crerub gazed upon the place once more, however, there was still something missing. Finally, she realized it — indeed, what kind of tea party is it without any friends?! There was no need to send a letter of invitation, as the guest had already been here, reading a tale. Dressed in dark, yet bearing scarlet eyes — she took her seat.

      <p>— "So tell me, how is it like to be a cat?"</p>
      <p><i>*Poof*</i> — an unremarkable black cat appeared in the place where girl once was.<br>
        — "At sunny days, I like to laze under warm shimmer; recluse from concerns outside my subsistence, feeling happy."<br>
        — "Happy..."<br>
        <br>
        The cat leapt gently into crerub's warm embrace.<br>
        — "Aw, that tickles!"
