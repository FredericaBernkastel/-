"I dropped my teacup in the desert," the girl wept. The girl searched the desert for a hundred years.
"Maybe I didn't drop it in the desert, but in the ocean," the girl wept. The girl searched the seafloor for a hundred years.
"Maybe I didn't drop it in the ocean, but the mountains," the girl wept. How many years will it be before she questions whether she really dropped one at all?

The frog in the well was happy.
It wasn't interested what lied outside the well.

I was the most unfortunate.
I knew that there was no exit out of this maze.

Then, she was the next unfortunate.
She did not know that there was no exit out of this maze.

I am who I am; A mere cat.
My age? I've gotten bored with it, so I've quit counting.

Huh? Are you speculating that the real identity of the girl is me?
Giggle giggle. You are so insolent.
The doll is the doll. You want me to introduce her to you? She's rather shy.
She gets frightened easily so don't scare her, okay? However, it seems that you are the one that's scared.

Giggle giggle giggle...

...She wanted to know the world that was outside of the well.
So she tried hard to get out from the bottom of the well.

She wanted to know the world that was outside of the well.
So she climbed up numerous of times despite falling down over and over again.

But then she realized it.
As higher and higher she clomb, the deeper she sank after every fall.

When her interest in the world outside of the well began to equal the amount of pain,
That was when she finally beknew the meaning of the story to Der Froschkönig.

Someone is patiently warming an egg.
If you warm it with love, then surely it's happiness that will be born.
It will be filled with love and joy.

Someone is patiently warming an egg.
If you warm it with rage, what will be born?

I am also warming an egg.
I am warming it with gas, so it doesn't matter which kind of egg it is.

...What kind of world lies outside of the well?
Is it something that is worth struggling for?

What kind of world lies outside of the well?
Is it something so attractive enough to fall and try over and over again?

What kind of world lies outside of the well?
Let's enjoy taking the despair of finding that out.

If I reach the world that yearn for, it must be a spectacular world.
Even if that world was another pit inside a well.

One upon a time, when God still appeared in front of people,
Bread came falling from the sky.
A number complained because it was not meat.

A number complained that bread was better.

Until he understands what makes everyone happy,
for the time being, he'll make water fall from the sky.

Rain came falling from the sky.
Everyone complained, saying that their clothes will get wet.

Fire came falling from the sky.
Everyone complained, saying that the houses would burn.

God came down from the sky.
Until he understands what makes everyone happy,
for the time being, he decides to not have anything fall.

Nothing came falling from the sky.
A number complained that they were abandoned by God.

Many things came falling from the sky.
A number complained, wanting God to choose the things that will fall.

A rain of huge rocks came falling from the sky.
With this, the voices of complaint finally disappeared.

Rain came falling from the sky.
A traveler passing by feels thankful.

God, I thank you for this unexpected weather.
Thanks to this, my journey doesn't need to be boring.

God saw him off without answering.
That's fine. God doesn't need to play with dice.
