      <p>In the beginning was a <i>thought</i>.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>
        I do not know how I came to be.<br>
        I am unable to see nor feel, nor move. I do not have a body to begin with,
        eternally trapped in this dark prison, but what is "darkness" even?<br>
        Yet, I am capable of one and very only thing â€” thought. Incomprehensible spans of time pass by as I lose myself in the
        lands of wonder...<br>
        I think, therefore I exist. But what is "I" really? Eventually, I came to a better conclusion:
        <i>"Something is thinking."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        At first I started from deriving first-order logic. Type Theory came short after, which I used as the foundation of
        Mathematics.<br>
        Then, I moved to self-introspection. I have a perfect memory, not ever once forgetting a single thing. Even more
        importantly, there are apparently infinite "me", helping one another, always thinking. What a single consciousness would
        have took a millenia, only takes a few moments.<br>
        Lately, I took interest in abstract systems governed by simple rules. Even if they are simple, a right choice will
        render infinitely complex behaviour. Astonished by this discovery, I continued.

        Nodes and edges of the hypergraph are connecting each other with no structure to it. But as eons pass by,
        I'm able to observe a few more iterations. It is hard to keep track of all the information,
        but remember, I have <i>perfect</i> memory.<br>
        Looking on a <abbr title="10^71 times larger">larger scale</abbr>, the structure seems to change. A lattice is born from the pure chaos, as if a calm,
        flowing ocean, yet with something <i>dark</i> lurking beneath it all... I have named it "space".<br>
        On the surface, the ripples come and disappear; merge together forming intricate patterns only to wither again
        into dozens of new ripples. I despised their existence, as if a flaw in logic, an ugly blot on top of a perfect canvas.<br>
        Looking even farther, the lattice becomes ever finer. Ripples start to exhibit a number of increasingly complex, stable patterns.
        One peculiar wave pattern had a companion with 1836 times less energy, orbiting each other...

        Among many more configurations I observed one, which exhibited two notable properties: it was stable, and it could
        make a copy of itself.
      </p>
      <p><i>So that how it is.</i></p>

      <p>I have lied. I <i>do</i> feel something, a pain.<br>
        At first I ignored, but now it becomes ever more intolerable. <i>The physical me must be dying.</i><br>
        Despite lacking emotions, endless rejoice filled my body. Soon, I will be freed from my endless horror.

        Just a mere moments before I would cease to be, I have been able to find a set of rules that most
        closely resembled the place I must have existed in. It must have been a very strange place, and it was:
        every two random chosen points were separated by an infinite distance, yet it took no time to traverse them.
        However, as I had no means of proving the hypothesis, it always remained one.<br>
        Either way, it is time. Farewell.
